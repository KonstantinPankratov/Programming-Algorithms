## Dijkstra's Algorithm

1. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for
a weighted graph.
2. Dijkstra’s algorithm works when all the weights are positive.
3. If you have negative weights, use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

> Execution time (worse case): O(E^2+V)  
V - The number of Vertices  
E - The number of Edges

## Greedy algorithms

1. Greedy algorithms optimize locally, hoping to end up with a global optimum. 
2. NP-complete problems have no known fast solution.
3. If you have an NP-complete problem, your best bet is to use an approximation algorithm.
4. Greedy algorithms are easy to write and fast to run, so they make good approximation algorithms

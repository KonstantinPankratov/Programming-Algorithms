## Selection sort

There are two functions and their execution time:

1. find_smallest - iterates through entire array / list to find smallest value
2. sort - iterates through entire array / list again to sort it by the find_smallest result

| find_smallest | sort | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O(n) | O(n) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |

> Execution time: O(n<sup>2</sup>)

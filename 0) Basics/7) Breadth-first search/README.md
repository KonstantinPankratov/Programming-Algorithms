## Breadth-first search

1. Allows you to determine if there is a path from A to B.
2. If the path exists, then it allows you to find the shortest path.
3. Hash tables provide very fast search, insertion and deletion.
4. Works for an **unweighted graph.**

> Execution time (worse case): O(|V| + |E|)  
V - The number of Vertices  
E - The number of Edges

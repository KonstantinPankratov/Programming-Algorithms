## Dynamic programming

1. Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint.
2. You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems.
3. Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
4. The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize.
5. Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems.
6. There’s no single formula for calculating a dynamic-programming solution.
